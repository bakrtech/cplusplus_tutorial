inline int prodouct(int a,int b){return a*b;}// The inline helps the command to work faster when we use command many times
// // What inline does is that it replaces the function with actual code inside the function and then it runs it 
// // It is only recomended for function wich are small as if the big func will be inline there would be more memory intake
